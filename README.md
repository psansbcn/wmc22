<h4>Eploratory</h4>
<p>The Notebooks show how the 2 datasets provided are used to analyse the data and provide some useful information about the activity of this Startup and learn if the <b>communications</b> are useful</p>
<p>The clients are divided into 6 segments and with some queries and visualisations some of this segments have clear distinctions</p>
<p>The second dataset, provides information on the conumption of different fruits, both by segments or by received information.</p>
<h4>Predictions</h4>
<p>The 2 datasets couldn't be merged to improve the prediction model, therefore only 3 features will be used</p>
<p>After the data has been transformed, two classification models have been tested (after running LazyClassifier*) resulting LGBMClassifier the best fit.<Br>
The confusion matrix shows in both cases a dfficulty to classify a particular segment, but the second gets better scores</p>
<h4>Methodology</h4>
<p>Python and data related libraries (Pandas, Scickit Learn,...) habe been the main developing code used<br>
The repository contains 2 Python Notebooks:<br>
- Eploratory: NewuFruit_WMC22.ipynb<br>
- ML model: NewuFruit_MLmodel.ipynb<br>
- Results table: results.csv</p>
